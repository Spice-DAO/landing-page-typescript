                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>At the top of that government is Leader Mastrich. Though hundreds upon hundreds of years old, Mastrich’s body is kept young and virile by arcane sciences. The only signs of his age are his voice and certain details of his body.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Leader Mastrich is meant to rule in perpetuity, to the very end of time. His word is law.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>To enforce this rule, he commands a vast and powerful military, armadas of spacecraft, and all the tools of propaganda.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But there is discontent growing from various quarters.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>One source of unrest comes from the POPULISTS who live on the outer edges of Mastrich’s domain. Their world is torn by civil conflict spurred by scarce resources and corrupt local magistrates.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Other sources of discontent are closer to home. In the capital city, the INDUSTRIALISTS are clamoring for permission to seed a new communication technology they think can change the society forever.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And there are those in the MILITARY that fear Mastrich has grown out of touch, unable to grapple with the changes rippling through his people. They think it might be time for a change.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The domain of Leader Mastrich is vast and expanding. Countless star systems, full of inhabited planets. To manage such an enormous domain requires both managerial skill and an array of technologies.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>To physically travel from star system to star system is a time and energy-consuming endeavor. If one were to board a ship on the Leader’s home world and pilot it to any of the outer reaches of inhabited space it might take roughly a month to two months of travel.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Communication times are less but still substantial. A message traveling the same distance as the above might take a week to arrive.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>This cumbersome speed of travel and communication has been the norm for as long as anyone can remember. The entirety of Mastrich’s government is built on systems of couriers and messengers, relays and elaborate comm systems.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>However, change is in the wind.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Recently, a new communication technology has come into use that can facilitate instantaneous communication between individuals separated by vast distances. The provenance of this technology is a closely guarded secret, held by the Industrialists who developed it.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Referred to by the name DKR, this communication technology is being widely adopted across the domain. The source code was first discovered by the Industrialists on the planet Dolkoroth, for which it is named. Unbeknownst to the Leader it has already become key to much of the communication between worlds.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>It is a technology with both industrial and consumer applications. DKR devices, holographic interfaces that operate from chips implanted under the skin, are becoming increasingly common among citizens. When someone logs into the DKR interface their face is illuminated in bright light and bold color.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The user is then able to interact with a virtual space that allows them to communicate with any other DKR user.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Thus far Mastrich has not grappled with the new reality the DKR technology heralds. Some of his closest advisors are pushing him to adopt it as his standard method of communication across all planets; others are pushing for him to regulate it; still others are pushing for him to ban it outright.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich does not realize it yet but the issue of this new communication device will forever change his domain.</div>

                                <div className='TinyHeader' style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>PALIS, THE DETECTIVE</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Male. Mid to late 20s. Sharp intellect, quick witted. He dresses in an inconspicuous manner, better, he thinks, to blend into a crowd than stand out.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis is a member of the elite branch of the military responsible for surveillance of the people and the keeping of the peace. Think of it like the secret police.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He is quite good at his job; he’s a keen observer of human nature and highly skeptical of everyone and everything.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The same qualities that have made him good at his job have also made him disliked among his peers and superiors. He extends the same skepticism to them as he does to those they’re watching.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>About a year before our story starts, Palis served as part of Mastrich’s personal guard. While in that position, he and Mastrich became friends. They would speak about philosophical questions, the nature of just leadership, the future of mankind.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich greatly appreciated Palis’ relentless probing of any question put to him.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>While serving in a position so close to Mastrich, Palis also became privy to certain uncomfortable truths about the Leader’s history. Specifically: he learned just how violent and ruthless the Leader’s rise to power really was. Pieces of a history now forgotten.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }}>Palis’s journey through the first season will see him change from someone who views himself to be an observer and revealer of truth to one who is forced to make a decision. Palis will, in the end, have to take an active part in determining the path forward for all of mankind.</div>


                                <div className='TinyHeader' style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>NYLO, THE POPULIST LEADER</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Male. Mid 20s. A freedom fighter. Nylo is ruggedly good looking. Imagine a young Che Guevara.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nylo is passionate, charismatic, and increasingly frustrated at his inability to help the people on his homeworld.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Through charisma and intelligence, Nylo has become the representative of a populist uprising currently unfolding at the edge of Masrich’s domain. In his role as representative, he works tirelessly to get Mastrich to do something about the plight of his people.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }}>His position in the capital is very precarious. He knows that among his constituency are those willing to use extreme violence to achieve their goals. For years he’s tried to keep his coalition peaceful but lately he has found himself swayed more and more towards violence.</div>


                                <div className='TinyHeader' style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>COSTARA, THE INDUSTRIALIST</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Female. Late 20s. Sharp and calculating. Unafraid to do what it takes to achieve her goals.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Costara believes that the DKR technology her company has developed will help build a better future for mankind. She passionately believes that widespread, unregulated use of the DKR interface would lead to a freer, more just society.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She also believes that it will lead to a windfall of profits for her and her cohorts.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She believes both of the above equally.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Costara is a manipulator by nature. She knows human psychology, she knows human emotion, and she knows how to put both to work to achieve her goals. She is an expert in getting people to think that her ideas are actually their own ideas.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }}>The sad irony at the heart of Costara’s character is that she thinks she’s in control of all around her, manipulating them to her own ends. But she in fact is only a pawn in a larger game. </div>



                                <div className='TinyHeader' style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>BARRABAN, THE GENERAL</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Male. Mid 30s. A skilled strategist and tactician. Veteran of a number of battles. Barraban’s face is scarred from combat. His heroism on the battlefield has helped him rise quickly in the ranks.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban is used to being in control, to being able to see all the angles of any situation.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Duty bound to protect humanity’s domain against all threats, Barraban is a stern figure who, when pushed, can become aggressive. He comes from a long line of military leaders that can trace their lineage all the way back to the very beginning of Leader Mastrich’s reign.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich views him almost as a surrogate son.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }}>However, of late, Barraban has begun to have doubts about Mastrich’s leadership. Mastrich has refused to allow the military to step in and put down Populist uprisings. This, to the General, signals weakness and a lack of will and it has birthed in him serious concerns about the future of Mastrich’s rule.</div>



                                <div className='TinyHeader' style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>CHRYLITH, THE EXPLORER</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Female. Early 20s. Chrylith is her ship’s captain and almost never seen without her flight suit on.
                                        She loves to travel through deep space, between worlds and colonies and stations. Her whole
                                        life is her ship, her whole life is transience.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Chrylith is part of a group of loosely affiliated starship captains. These are people who make
                                        their living, and find their joy, by moving through physical space. Some are explorers, some are
                                        intergalactic couriers, some specialize in the transportation of physical goods. They are the
                                        people that make Mastrich’s rule work, on a day-to-day basis.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Chrylith is stalwartly anti-DKR. To her and other starship captains, this new communication
                                        interface is a threat. If communication is instantaneous, there is no need for their services. If
                                        exploration is now done via simulation, there is no need to push the physical boundaries any
                                        longer.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Like many other ship captains, Chrylith often takes on smuggling jobs, moving elicit product for
                                        a few extra credits. It’s her opinion that a healthy smuggling economy is just as key to
                                        Mastrich’s rule as any other economy.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }}>Chrylith is an introvert by nature, much more comfortable with ship machinery, with the
                                        emptiness of deep space, than she is with other people.</div>



                                <div className='TinyHeader' style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>DOLKOROTH, THE PLANET</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>DKR is the new communication tech that is seeding itself across Mastrich’s domain.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>It seems to be an advanced communication system, capable of facilitating the flow of
                                        information at a rate faster than light.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But the truth is that by connecting to DKR, users are connecting their minds to an alien
                                        intelligence. This alien intelligence was discovered inside an ancient tomb on a far flung planet
                                        not previously explored called Dolkoroth.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>At first, this alien intelligence looked merely like some kind of fungal organic matter. But once
                                        the Industrialists began experimenting with it, they quickly discovered that it could link human
                                        minds, instantaneously, across vast distances.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And with that discovery, they began investigating ways to utilize it.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The DKR device is a subcutaneous implant that creates a translucent holo-visor over the user’s
                                        face.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>You can always tell a person is interacting with their DKR because their whole face is lit up with
                                        a particular color.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Once connected to the interface the user sees a three-dimensional room from which they can
                                        access various tools including communication with other users.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Use of the interface has already spread far and wide across the universe.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As more and more users log into the DKR interface, the Industrialists are discovering more and
                                        more uses for it, including its ability to anticipate user response, and run simulations of group
                                        behavior.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The truth of DKR is that it is NOT a benign passive network, but rather an alien intelligence that
                                        seeks to expand. Mankind is the most convenient means to do so.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>When a person uses any DKR interface they are actually giving Dolkoroth access to the
                                        neurochemical make-up of their own brains. Dolkoroth can take root there, reading the user,
                                        implanting itself.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Because of the vast number of DKR users, Dolkoroth is acquiring a deep and intimate
                                        knowledge of how mankind works, on a neurochemical, societal and psychological level.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Dolkoroth knows humanity better than it knows itself and is willing to use billions of people for
                                        its own ends.</div>

                                        quite add up: his veins are purplish, varicose, his eyes strangely wizened.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He looks down at an ornate visualization device, complicated in design. The device shows the
                                        locations of the main hubs of his empire, as well as the shipping lines around them, the military
                                        forces deployed and where...</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Worlds upon worlds, billions upon billions of lives represented in miniature. He considers it all.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nearby a screen scrolls with endless requests for his attention. "Monetary support needed..."
                                        "Your consul would be most welcome on this matter..." "Your honor, the people of our planet
                                        request your presence..." on and on and on. A constant reminder of the full weight of his
                                        enormous domain.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>A world at the far edge of the starmap blinks with warning. Data about an ongoing war streams
                                        from this planet. Mastrich takes it in. Thinking.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>A small side door opens. An AIDE enters silently.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich speaks, his voice somehow old and young at the same time. "It is time, I suppose."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The Aide nods and Mastrich moves across the room to stand inside a circle etched into the
                                        ground. As he steps into it, it LIGHTS and an ornate ceremonial body armor rises from the
                                        ground, begins attaching itself to his body.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"I wonder... do people still expect me to lead? Or do they simply expect me to maintain?"</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The Aide raises his eyebrows. Unsure where this line of questioning will take him.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Leader Mastrich, I don’t know how to answer that - "</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"No. No I suppose you wouldn’t."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Their one-sided conversation continues. Mastrich is concerned with the course of history, with
                                        questions of change and a leader’s duty. The aide is concerned only that he be on time for the
                                        celebration.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Finally, resplendent in his suit of armor, he steps from the circle. "I’m ready. Let’s go celebrate a
                                        thousand years, shall we?"</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>With Aide trailing him, the Leader strides forward and pushes open a set of enormous double
                                        doors. Behind them is a darkened hall, an unknown future.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Later, inside a baroque and vaulted hall, lit with heavenly golden light, guests arrive and mingle.
                                        They’re dressed in their finest, an array of fashions and fabric. Human voices rise and mingle.
                                        Laughter, whispers, pleasantries.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>We find Costara in the center of the party, standing in a group with some fellow Industrialists.
                                        Her eyes move coldly over the party, assessing everyone, until finally they come to stop on one
                                        of her aides.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>His face is lit up in glorious light. He is using a DKR device.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She chastises him. "Have some respect. You know Leader Mastrich doesn’t like our devices to
                                        be used in the palace. We need to be careful if we’re to properly make our case."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Just then, a commotion at the front of the room garners her attention.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And there at the front, Nylo gesticulates as he talks. Making grand sweeping statements about
                                        the needs of his people. "Imagine the suffering, unnecessary. Know that the injustice is
                                        unnecessary! A product of neglect."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nearby, Mastrich stands on a dais, watching Nylo’s display. Mastrich’s face is inscrutable as he
                                        takes in the scene.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Behind Mastrich, General Barraban grows increasingly angry at Nylo’s antics.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Leader Mastrich, we ought to do something about him," he says.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich shakes his head. "No no, let him bluster. It’s good for him. Good for people to hear
                                        dissent."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban feels eyes on him from across the room. Looks up and sees Costara. Their eyes meet.
                                        A private smile graces her lips. He gives her a polite, formal nod as more guests move into the
                                        room... as the music rises in volume... as drinks are served...</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Outside the main hall, down the opulent arrival hallway, through a side door way, lies the
                                        servant’s access route. And it’s there we find the starship captain Chrylith, adjusting her outfit,
                                        preparing to enter the party.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nervous, insecure she lets out a little sigh.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Are you lost?" The voice catches her off guard. She turns to find Detective Palis leaning on the
                                        wall behind her. He’s dressed simply, a far cry from the opulence in the main room.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"No no, not lost. Just... unsure," she says.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Ah, well that might be worse than lost. I’d rather be confidently lost than ambiguously found."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>They make brief introductions and he tells her he used to work in the palace. "Trust me," he
                                        says "everyone in there will be more concerned with their own looks than yours."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Together they walk into the party.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Inside, Barraban spots Palis immediately and, with two hulking armed power-armored soldiers
                                        flanking him, he cuts through the party towards him.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Seeing the soldiers approach, Chrylith ducks into the crowd and disappears into the throng of
                                        celebrants.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban wants to know what Palis is doing there. Palis shrugs and says he received a personal
                                        invite from Mastrich but that’s all he knows.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>They have a terse conversation that hints at a complicated past. They’re friends but there’s also
                                        jealousy and suspicion between them. Palis ends the conversation to speak with Mastrich.
                                        Barraban watches him go.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"How do you remember your time serving as my guard?" Mastrich asks Palis. Food has been
                                        served. The two men sit at the ceremonial banquet table, the party arrayed out around them.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Fondly," Palis replies. "I miss our conversations."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Me as well," Mastrich smiles.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich goes on to tell him that he’s going to bring Palis back to his personal guard. He needs
                                        someone with Palis’s keen mind close to him. Mastrich has started to feel that he cannot trust
                                        those closest to him. And, even worse, he’s starting to fear that his mind is slipping.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"I sometimes don’t even know what questions I should be asking, my friend. I need someone
                                        close, someone unafraid to ask any question, unafraid to question any answer."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis nods. Says he’ll do it. Anything for his Leader.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich hands Palis a small, ceremonial disc, inscribed with his sigil, ceremonially infused with
                                        his authority.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Moments later. We find Nylo at his table. Working up the confidence to do what he feels must
                                        be done. Finally he stands and raises his voice, getting the attention of all the gathered guests
                                        and demands that Mastrich engage with him and his demands here and now in front of
                                        everyone.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich smiles, kindly, and tells Nylo to go ahead.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>An argument ensues between them. Nylo argues for freedom for his planet, for self-

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Mastrich meets each of Nylo’s propositions with fatherly aphorisms.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nylo grows increasingly upset: "I don’t want platitudes! I want action - "</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban joins the argument. Suggesting that further military action would silence all of Nylo’s
                                        complaints, swiftly and easily.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Costara steps in to counter his argument; her position is that her DKR technology if properly
                                        used could facilitate a diplomatic solution.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban scoffs. "And what price will they have to pay for your tech? To line your pockets is not

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The Leader shakes his head: "My mind is not made up on technology from obsolete worlds. I
                                        see its utility but I also fear it will have unforeseen uses."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The argument continues. Spinning out into the philosophies of each character; Nylo growing
                                        more and more angry.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis watches it all, spinning the sigil disc in his hand.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Later. The revelry rises in tone and tempo. Dancing ensues. In various corners of the hall,
                                        people now openly use the DKR interface, their faces illuminated by strange and beautiful
                                        colors.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>In the haze of the party, Palis feels the pressure of what Mastrich has asked of him.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Then he spots something strange. Barraban and Costara in the corner.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>They aren’t arguing. They’re talking.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He looks closer. No, they aren’t just talking; there’s an intimacy there, a flirtation. They touch
                                        each other. Like lovers would.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But then a quick movement catches his eyes. Nylo. Storming through the crowd. Making for the
                                        exit. Ranting to his aides about how Mastrich has refused his requests for the last time.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis’s eyes go from Nylo back to Barraban and Costara then to Mastrich, sitting above it all at
                                        his table. The swell of faces, the rise of the music, it all starts to swirl around him. Details blur.
                                        He sees Nylo leave. He sees Barraban break away from Costara. He sees Chrylith for a moment,
                                        across the room.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And then, an EXPLOSION rips through the front of the party.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The initial blast sends debris tearing through the crowd shredding bodies. Overhead, the golden
                                        lights shatter from the impact, and a rain of glass and debris impales the terrified guests.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The music is replaced by screams of horror, wails of pain.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis, caught off guard, struck dumb for a moment, merely stares at the chaos.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But then he remembers himself. He turns, his eyes go from the carnage at the front of the hall
                                        to the back, to where the Leader should be and isn’t.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis runs through the crowd. His feet track through growing pools of blood, past bodies torn
                                        and mangled until finally he bursts through a door at the back of the hall.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>There he finds Mastrich, fallen. His body is contorted and twitching, his skin bubbling and
                                        melting. His teeth jut out of his mouth as the skin slides away. His eyes are locked open, staring
                                        at the ceiling which is on fire.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>General Barraban has established military rule over the government. He’s ordered platoons of
                                        power-armored soldiers to maintain order in the capital city and beyond.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>We find Barraban and Costara together in his inner chambers. Locked in a lover’s embrace. But
                                        it is time for them to part.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She leaves him, and passes by Detective Palis in the hall. He’s waiting to see Barraban. They
                                        exchange a look. Palis puts a finger to his own lips, signaling he won’t tell anyone that she and
                                        Barraban are lovers.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis enters Barraban’s chambers. He wants to know what’s happening with the investigation.
                                        The old animosity between them ripples in the air; Barraban would prefer to not have him
                                        involved.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But then Palis shows him Mastrich’s sigil coin. For Barraban it still has meaning. "He wanted me
                                        to help him. And I never had the chance," Palis says.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>This shared loyalty to their dead leader stirs something in Barraban. He tells Palis that the
                                        military has already determined the guilty party: Nylo and his populists.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>If Palis wants to be useful, wants to honor the memory of their departed leader, he can travel
                                        to Nylo’s homeworld and perform the arrest himself.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis nods and accepts the assignment. But there is doubt behind his eyes. Mastrich sees it. "His
                                        guilt is assured. Do not question it, Palis. The domain of man needs justice not doubt."</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Later, from a military transport ship, Palis watches his home world disappear in the aft
                                        viewport. Accompanying him on his mission is a squad of military power-armored soldiers who
                                        specialize in interrogation and rendition.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>On the ship, Palis watches as a soldier uses a DKR device to receive further intel. An informant
                                        on the planet has revealed Nylo’s location. This operation will be a simple smash and grab.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nylo’s homeworld is torn and ravaged by an ongoing war. Even from orbit, the devastation is
                                        clear. Massive fires burn continuously, spewing smoke up into the atmosphere. The few bodies
                                        of water on the planet are filled with garbage. Space junk like ruined military satellites spin,
                                        uselessly, around the planet in slowly deteriorating orbit.</div>

                                        up. It slams to the ground, landing aggressively in the middle of a bombed-out city.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Its loading bay door opens and the soldiers escort Palis out into the wreckage. Locals eye them
                                        with fear and awe, these tall power-armored soldiers are like warrior-gods when compared to
                                        combatants on their world. They strike a fearsome contrast to the unarmored, plain clothed
                                        Palis.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nylo is hidden away in a massive subterranean bunker located on the outskirts of the once
                                        massive city. Moving towards it, Palis is struck by the devastation around him. He’s never seen
                                        a place like this before.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The entryway to the bunker is guarded by a few combatants. They’re quickly and easily
                                        dispatched by Palis’s squad.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Inside, the bunker is a rabbit warren of rooms and hallways. It’s a place where people could
                                        survive a war for years.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As they sweep the darkened rooms and halls, Palis spots something unexpected: Chrylith, the
                                        ship captain. She RUNS as soon as she’s spotted. Darting away into the darkness of the bunker.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis loses sight of her.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But soon after, Nylo is located. He’s holed up in a dimly lit chamber full of maps and political
                                        tracts. A gun is in his hand and a DKR device is on the table in front of him. The soldiers want to
                                        burst in and kill him but Palis orders them back. He’ll go in by himself, alone.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As Palis enters, Nylo, twitchy and nervous, raises a gun, aims it at him.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis holds his hands up. Says he’s just there to talk, he just wants to understand what’s
                                        happened and why. He wants to give Nylo a chance to explain himself.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>If there’s one thing Nylo can’t resist, it’s a chance to talk.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis and Nylo have a tense conversation about what’s happened. Nylo admits to the bombing,
                                        it was necessary to raise awareness, to get people to pay attention. He needed to do it. But he
                                        also says the bombing wasn’t his idea, not originally.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The idea to do it came from messages from the DKR interface. The idea was formed there,
                                        planned there... everything.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"What about the assassination?" Palis asks.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Nylo slams his fist down on the table. Swears he did not do that. He fears he’s been used by
                                        someone else, someone who needed a distraction.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Before Palis can ask anything else, the soldiers burst into the room. Nylo points his gun
                                        reflexively and the soldiers shoot him dead.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"What are you doing?!" Palis shouts.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"By order of Barraban" they tell him. "Justice is done. We will spread the word." Palis watches
                                        as one of the soldiers uses his DKR to broadcast the news.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She stonewalls him. "You get nothing from me."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Before he can push harder, the door to the shack opens and a group of stone-faced men enter.
                                        Palis sees them. Sees them clock Chrylith. Sees their hands go under their cloaks -</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He grabs Chrylith and throws her to the ground just as the place is lit up by gun fire.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis and Chrylith battle their way out of the place and flee to the spaceport where her ship is
                                        docked. They race on board and she pushes him down into a seat as she lights up the control

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Once they’re clear of the planet, Palis takes in details of the ship. It’s an industrial grade
                                        transport craft, but she’s customized it. Tricked it out. It is both her work AND her home.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She catches him looking the ship over. Gives him a small tour, clearly it’s a source of pride for

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Who were they?" he asks.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She doesn’t know and is bothered by the fact he didn’t recognize their assailants. He is secret

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Having looked over the ship, Palis has spotted details that lead him to believe she runs a
                                        smuggling operation. That must be why she was at Mastrich’s palace. "A delivery, was it?"</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Don’t worry, he assures her, he doesn’t care about the smuggling. He knows lots of captains do
                                        it.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She admits it. But also admits that it was a strange set of circumstances. The job came via an
                                        anonymous message on DKR; she hates the device, views it to be the impending end of her line
                                        of work. BUT everyone is starting to use it. If you want work, you have to dabble.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And so she did. And that’s how she got this job. She was not to know the cargo. The request
                                        was odd but not unheard of.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>What was the most strange, however, was delivering directly to the palace on that night.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But she could use the money, so she did the job. When Palis met her at the event, she’d just
                                        made the drop off and was going to stick around to check out the celebration. "They don’t
                                        normally invite cargo haulers to things like that. I couldn’t pass up the opportunity."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But then the explosion, the assassination, the chaos.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"You think you were being used? That you smuggled in the assassination device?" Palis asks.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She does. And ever since it happened, she has been followed. She thought at first Nylo could
                                        keep her safe but that didn’t pan out, obviously.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"What did you deliver?" he asks.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Just a box. No markings. No manifest. Payment handled anonymously.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis recalls Nylo’s claim that DKR was used in planning the bombing, and now it appears again
                                        with Chrylith’s involvement...</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Chrylith goes on a screed against DKR, laments how she’s been forced to use it in elements of
                                        her ship’s communication, forced to use it to get work.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis admits he’s never used DKR but now it might be time.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis turns the small DKR device over in his hand. The design is sleek but strangely organic in

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Then, he inserts it in his wrist and it switches on. As it does his face is hit with a blast of bright
                                        white light. It strobes for a beat, booting up its interface. And then Palis finds himself inside the
                                        virtual reality.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>It presents itself to the eye as a physical space, a blank room, but as the interface learns more
                                        about him by reading his mind, the space becomes more and more personalized.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>From within this strange virtual space, Palis can communicate with any other user logged into
                                        DKR anywhere in humanity’s domain.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He can also log in to messaging areas that have retained previously sent messages.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And there he discovers what Nylo said was true: there is a cache of anonymous messages
                                        pushing the bombing, suggesting the day of Mastrich’s celebration.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He can also see the anonymous messages sent to Chrylith. The messages bear a certain
                                        resemblance to each other.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis logs off. His eyes take a minute to readjust to daylight.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"We need to talk to the people behind this technology," he says.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Chrylith plots a course for Costara’s homeworld.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As they travel, Palis finds himself thinking about his interaction with the DKR interface. It was
                                        strangely comforting to feel so connected to others, to be surrounded by their voices.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He signs back in.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Dominated by sleek, curved architecture constructed from glass and steel, Costara’s world is a
                                        far cry from the savage destruction of Nylo’s planet and the lived-in comfort of Chrylith’s ship. It
                                        is a place given over, body and soul, to the latest cutting edge technology.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Towering DKR relay stations push skyward even from within the very heart of the city. The
                                        transmission towers are triumphs of design and technology, constant reminders of just how
                                        vast the reach of Dolkoroth is becoming.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Upon entering the planet’s orbit, Palis sends a message to Costara informing her that he has
                                        come to ask her some questions about Dolkoroth. She graciously accepts the invitation,
                                        granting them permission to land.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"It wasn’t an invitation," Palis says wryly to Chrylith.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Inside her headquarters Costara greets them with a smile and her signature brand of charm.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>She leads them on a small tour of the spotless building before ushering them into a sleek
                                        boardroom dominated by screens showing various new technologies.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The guests are left alone for a beat. Long enough for Palis and Chrylith to register a certain
                                        suspicion of Costara and her whole charm offensive.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Finally, Costara re-enters the boardroom and stands at the head of the table. "Ask me
                                        anything," she says.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And so Palis does. Their conversation goes from the broadly philosophical discussing
                                        technological advancement and its role in the future of society, to the personal and specific.
                                        "What were you doing at the party?" and "Can you identify the senders of the anonymous
                                        messages in the archives of DKR?"</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Costara is a highly skilled conversationalist. She prevaricates with such subtlety it almost goes
                                        unnoticed. Almost.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis pushes harder, seeking to fluster her. But just as the conversation reaches its climax, a
                                        group of aides enter the room.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>They inform Costara that General Barraban has refused her request for a personal discussion
                                        about the future use of DKR in the military. She will meet his deadline for production and
                                        delivery of devices.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis watches as she receives this news. Watches as her facade slips for a second, and behind it
                                        a well of emotion. Fear mixed with something else. She’s hiding something, definitely.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But then the mask goes back up. She smiles at her guests. "Please, stay the night. We can
                                        continue our talk tomorrow."</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>That night, Palis and Chrylith sneak from their suites to explore the headquarters. They make
                                        their way down into a laboratory. It is full of new DKR devices, not yet customized for the
                                        public. They are missing the safeguards programmed into the consumer version.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis takes one and uses it. As the light hits his face, he finds himself in a different version of the
                                        virtual reality. The room that normally bounds his activity in the protocol is not there. And he’s
                                        able to push into areas he’s not meant to see.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Using this device, he is able to decode the anonymous messages received by Chrylith. They
                                        confirm his fears.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Costara herself hired Chrylith to smuggle the device into Mastrich’s celebration.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Discovering this, Palis knows he has to report the truth to Barraban. But he also knows it will
                                        make Chrylith an accomplice.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He decides to warn Chrylith. He tells her to flee, get off the planet and hide somewhere. But
                                        before she runs, she kisses him. A confirmation that they have feelings for each other. Then she
                                        departs.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis contacts Barraban.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban takes the news that his lover is a traitor with almost no discernible emotion. Instead
                                        he immediately orders her arrest.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis watches as a squad of power-armored soldiers drag Costara from her home.</div>

                                        inside the heart of the universe’s premiere military power, a vast, grim, brutalist structure.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Costara is put on trial. It is swift. Evidence from the DKR interface leaves no doubt she is guilty.
                                        The sentence is handed down: immediate execution.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As Costara is put to death, Palis watches Barraban’s face. Sees there just the slightest twinge of
                                        emotion.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Costara’s eyes burn silently at Barraban. The betrayal on her face.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis considers this.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Later, in Barraban’s office, he oversees the military takeover of production and distribution of
                                        DKR technology from Costara’s company.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis enters, wondering if Barraban has a moment. He begins by stating a simple fact: "You and
                                        Costara were lovers."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban nods. "Difficult then, what’s just happened," Palis says.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis recalls how he saw Barraban with Costara at Mastrich’s celebration. But just before the
                                        bombing, he saw them go in separate directions. At the time, Palis says, he thought they were
                                        just trying to hide their affair.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>But now the timing seems odd. She was heading for safety, away from where she knew the
                                        explosion would erupt. He went in another direction. Back into the party.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Towards Mastrich.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis is smarter than to outright accuse Barraban of the assassination BUT the implication is
                                        clear.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban never admits guilt. But he does speak about Mastrich. How their Leader had grown
                                        blind to the future of humanity. Blind to the fact that DKR needed to be put to use, it needed to
                                        spread. Humanity needed it to grow.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>And once Mastrich was in charge, and seeding DKR throughout the domain, Costara started to
                                        put roadblocks in his way. She wanted to control the supply of it, use the increase in demand to
                                        benefit herself. And when he said no, she tried to use his emotions against him.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"So, it works out nicely that I discovered she had Mastrich killed," Palis notes.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban nods. "Yes, yes it does." There is pain in his voice.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis says he’ll leave Barraban to his work but before he goes, he has one last question. One last
                                        thing that’s bothering him.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"The whole thing, whatever you have or haven’t done... it was all to spread the technology?"</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"It was for the future of mankind."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"Yes, and to you that means spreading Dolkoroth."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban nods. "Yes. Of course."</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis leaves Barrban’s chambers, lost in contemplation of what he’s just learned. He turns a
                                        corner and finds himself confronted with a cadre of secret police.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban has ordered him arrested. "What is the charge?" Palis asks.</div>

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>On board Chrylith’s ship, as it speeds through space, Palis goes over the evidence. "Everyone
                                        had a motivation in this plot but no motivation was greater than the one held by Dolkoroth
                                        itself."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Chrylith doesn’t understand.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis goes on to explain that he thinks the technology itself wants to be spread. It’s using
                                        humanity as a means to expand. It manipulated Nylo. It manipulated Costara. It manipulated
                                        Barraban.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis has Chrylith pull up a star map that marks the central hub connecting all DKR
                                        transmissions. She sets a course for the planet Dolkoroth.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barely lit by the strange, dim light of a distant star, the colors on this world are dark and rich.
                                        Shadows are constant. The vegetation is thick and strange, it curls up on itself creating a dense
                                        jungle that almost looks fungal in nature.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The only man made structure is an enormous ancient relay tower that juts up miles above the
                                        foliage below. It pulses with energy.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Chrylith lands next to it and together she and Palis enter the looming tower.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The structure is totally abandoned. Whoever built it is long since gone. An automated relay
                                        program keeps it functioning, keeping the Dolkoroth protocol active.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The building contains records of how the planet was discovered and what happened afterward.
                                        This record shows the truth: Dolkoroth is not an interface; the core of it is not technological in
                                        nature. Dolkoroth is organic. It lives on this world. When you log into it, you’re connecting your
                                        mind to the strange alien mind that inhabits this world.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis decides to confront Dolkoroth itself.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Here, so close to the source, there is no need to connect to DKR to speak to the alien
                                        intelligence. Instead, in the basement of the building, Palis finds the open entrance to a cave,
                                        the lair of Dolkoroth.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He enters it. The walls undulate around him. Here vines composed of a fleshy substance in dark
                                        purple and garish red sway though no wind is present.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>He continues walking slowly until he is engulfed in darkness. In the silence Palis and Dolkoroth
                                        commune.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>They speak to one another telepathically. It already knows him very well. Just as it knows
                                        everyone who uses DKR. It knows what he values most in life: order, justice and the truth. It
                                        knows how to motivate him and not upset that balance.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>"You do not need to ask your questions, Detective," Dolkoroth says to Palis. "For I already know
                                        what they are."</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Yes, it did engineer the plot to rid the universe of Mastrich. Yes, it did manipulate Barraban to
                                        kill Costara. But it is also true what Barrban said: spreading Dolkoroth is good for mankind. It
                                        makes sense for the future of the species. Communication is key and Dolkoroth is
                                        communication. Mankind needs Dolkoroth to continue to expand and Dolkoroth needs
                                        mankind to help it spread its influence. This is the ideal symbiosis.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban has become the unwitting protector of this ongoing symbiosis. He is unknowingly
                                        aiding the domination of the universe by Dolkoroth.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Dolkoroth explains to Palis the truth of the future of mankind. That it is better off being steered
                                        and directed by a central intelligence. This is best.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis understands the sense in this. He sees that Dolkoroth’s point is logical and correct:
                                        symbiosis will benefit mankind. It would be the most logical thing not to disrupt what is already
                                        happening.</div>
                                <AsteriskText />

                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis stumbles out of the cave. Dazed. Upset at what he’s learned. Chrylith helps him back to
                                        the surface only to discover that Barraban and a platoon of his fearsome power-armored
                                        soldiers await them outside the relay station.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Palis walks forward to meet his fate. As he does, Dolkoroth’s words echo in his mind. And as
                                        they do, a decision galvanizes in his thoughts. Despite all the sense that Dolkoroth has made,
                                        Palis cannot let it be.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As he is arrested by Barraban, Palis tells him that he has been manipulated. Manipulated into
                                        killing the leader he served... manipulated into killing the woman he loved... manipulated into
                                        tying mankind’s fate to an unknowable alien intelligence.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban takes the information in silently. The reality of what he has done begins to sink in and
                                        he realizes that he is not a grand strategist, but instead that he has been manipulated and
                                        tricked.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban turns to his platoon and gives a simple order. “Destroy it.”</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The soldiers pause for a second, unsure. Barraban repeats his order: "Whatever it is, destroy
                                        it!"</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As the order rings out, the ground beneath their feet rumbles. Great fissures open up beneath
                                        them, revealing repulsive organic maws.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The whole planet is alive; the whole planet is the alien creature Dolkoroth. And now that it has
                                        been directly threatened, it will defend itself.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The fire of heavy weaponry roars through the air, explosive rounds tearing into the earth,
                                        raining down onto the relay structure.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban himself leads his men forward, down through the destruction, towards the cave that
                                        leads to the heart of the alien creature. As they enter the darkness, their shoulder-mounted
                                        lamps illuminate further horrors. The corpses of long dead visitors to the planet begin to move
                                        with life as they are reanimated by Dolkoroth.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As the battle underground rages, the surface of the planet comes alive, growing dangerous and
                                        unstable. Enormous fleshy appendages rip free from the ground, smashing into soldiers and
                                        destroying everything in their path.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Through this nightmarish scene, Palis and Chrylith run for her ship.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>As the relay station crashes down to the ground behind them, they take off. Chrylith pilots the
                                        ship away from the destruction, narrowly avgonna justoiding the enormous fleshy limbs of Dolkoroth
                                        reaching out to the stars.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Meanwhile Barraban, alone and badly wounded, his shoulder light quickly failing, finds the very
                                        core of the planet. Not a brain, not a heart, instead it is a pulsing, repulsive, utterly alien organ.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Barraban arms an explosive and slumps to the ground, satisfied that his work is about to be
                                        done.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The ensuing explosion ripples outward from the planet’s core causing the entire surface to
                                        erupt outward, spewing fleshy chunks of the creature out into orbit.</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>From deep space, Chrylith and Palis are happy to be alive... but then they notice that all her
                                        ship’s communication systems are malfunctioning...</div>
                                <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The final reveal: Dolkoroth was already the basis for communication between ships and
                                        planets... and with its death, mankind has become cut off from itself. Palis and Chrylith are left
                                        in space, alone together, heading into an unknown future.</div>
